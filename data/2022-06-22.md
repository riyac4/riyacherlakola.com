## Dates: June 17th to June 20th

Over the weekend I took a trip to Chicago to visit some of my college friends. It was such a fun trip and I ended up doing a lot of things. I've been to Chicago twice before and always enjoyed myself. I went once in the winter and again last year in the summer. Chicago is a great city but to me it paled in comparison to New York, a city that I much rather go to. After this trip though, that might be changed.
