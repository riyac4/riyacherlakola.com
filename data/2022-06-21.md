## The origins

I wanted to create this blog in order to have a way to express my thoughts, ideas, and a place to post reviews. I love to consume content. Books, TV Shows, Movies, Podcasts, Articles... really anything that I can find value from I will keep track of in this blog. I think I might try to take notes or jot down specfic topics. I have yet to decide. Maybe I'll do a mix of the both. I don't want this to be too perosnal because anyone can read it. Ok that is it for now. I should try to code some more things before I write more posts. Peace out!
